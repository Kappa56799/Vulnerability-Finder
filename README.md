# Vulnerability-Finder

## Description
A Simple Vulnerability Finder Tool in Go to find any vulnerabilities inside folders and files. This uses OPENAI GPT-4 model which means this tool should only be used to get an outline of possible vulnerabilities as many vulnerabilities are not detected by this tool or are false positives. This tool is not a replacement for any security tools, it's just a small project to get an idea of how AI can be used to find vulnerabilities and to scan simple code for school assignments and possibly use in CTFs.

## Requirements
- Go
- OPENAI API Key

# How to find your API key
Go to this website [Your API Key!](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), log in and create a key!

## Usage
To run the program you firstly need to set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to your API key. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal or by putting this command into your shell config (fish,zsh,bash):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your key here>"
```

Then you can run the program by running the following command:
```bash
go run main.go <path to folder or file> <more files or folders>
```
